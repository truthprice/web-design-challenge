# Web-Design-Challenge

## Description

The purpose and motivation of this project is to host a webpage that shows visualizations of city latitudes compared with different weather phenomena. The site gives us the ability to share visuals and data via a webpage rather than using programming software alone. The website allows one to see the visuals along with analysis for each graph, including latitude vs max temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and windspeed. Through our observations, we were able to gather that there does appear to be a correlation between latitude and max temperature. However, the other three factors compared with latitude did not yield strong correlations. 

## Usage

The site includes a dropdown menu on each page for easy access to any of the visuals and analysis. Additionally, the website includes a data page and a comparisons page. Any of the images under the "Visualizations" section are linked to their respective pages on the site.
